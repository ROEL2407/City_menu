## Where is this repository for?
This repository is for my lessons from the minor Web Development from the HvA. 

## What's the goal of this repository?
In this repository I've made a restaraunt menu with only css. This so I can get a full understanding of what CSS really can do

## Usage
With this application you can look through some of the art objects Rijksmuseum has to offer. You can get more information about the pieces and make your own perspectives on it.
